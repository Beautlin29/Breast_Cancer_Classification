# Breast Cancer Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on breast cancer classification using machine learning techniques. It aims to build a model that can accurately classify breast tumors as `benign` or `malignant` based on a set of features derived from medical imaging.

## Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from scikit-learn is used for training and testing the classification models. It contains 30 features such as mean radius, mean texture, mean smoothness, and more.
